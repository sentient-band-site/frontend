                A 5-piece band from Tokyo with modern metal, post-rock, and
                ambient music influences If there is a singular concept behind
                the band, it might be best described as an effort to transmute
                darkness and pain into light, without constraints on style and
                execution. As the name eludes to, the music of Sentient is about
                visceral feeling, and many of the lyrical themes are derived
                from dark personal experiences and finding the light and beauty
                in them.
