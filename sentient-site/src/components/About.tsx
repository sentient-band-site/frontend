              A 5-piece band from Tokyo with modern metal, post-rock, and
              ambient music influences If there is a singular concept behind the
              band, it might be best described as an effort to transmute
              darkness and pain into light, without constraints on style and
              execution. As the name eludes to, the music of Sentient is about
              visceral feeling, and many of the lyrical themes are derived from
              dark personal experiences and finding the light and beauty in
              them.
