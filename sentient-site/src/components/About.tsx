          <p>
            A 5-piece band from Tokyo with modern metal, post-rock, and ambient
            music influences If there is a singular concept behind the band, it
            might be best described as an effort to transmute darkness and pain
            into light, without constraints on style and execution. As the name
            eludes to, the music of Sentient is about visceral feeling, and many
            of the lyrical themes are derived from dark personal experiences and
            finding the light and beauty in them.
